       "1. **Collecte et Préparation des Données :**\n",
       "   - Rassembler les données pertinentes sur les clients, y compris les historiques de crédit, les revenus, les dettes, et d'autres facteurs financiers.\n",
       "   - Nettoyer les données pour éliminer les valeurs manquantes ou aberrantes.\n",
       "   - Organiser les données de manière claire et standardisée, souvent dans un tableau avec des lignes et des colonnes.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Exploration des Données :**\n",
       "   - Analyser la structure des données pour comprendre les relations entre les différentes variables.\n",
       "   - Utiliser des outils de visualisation pour identifier les tendances et les anomalies.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Sélection des Caractéristiques :**\n",
       "   - Identifier les caractéristiques les plus pertinentes qui pourraient influencer le défaut de paiement.\n",
       "   - Utiliser des techniques de réduction de dimensionnalité si nécessaire pour simplifier le modèle.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Choix du Modèle :**\n",
       "   - Sélectionner un modèle de machine learning approprié, tel que la régression logistique, les arbres de décision, ou les forêts aléatoires.\n",
       "   - Considérer l'utilisation de modèles plus avancés comme les réseaux de neurones si les données sont suffisamment volumineuses et complexes.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Entraînement du Modèle :**\n",
       "   - Diviser les données en ensembles d'entraînement et de test.\n",

       "\n",
       "6. **Évaluation du Modèle :**\n",
       "   - Tester le modèle sur l'ensemble de test pour évaluer sa précision et sa capacité à prédire les défauts de paiement.\n",
       "   - Utiliser des métriques telles que l'accuracy, le rappel, et la précision pour évaluer la performance.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Optimisation et Validation :**\n",
       "   - Affiner le modèle en ajustant les hyperparamètres et en utilisant des techniques de validation croisée.\n",

       "\n",
